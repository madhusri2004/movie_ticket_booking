üéüÔ∏è Movie Ticket Booking Management System

A simple Python-based Movie Ticket Booking Management System that enables users to create, view, update, and delete movie ticket bookings.
This project uses a dictionary to store booking details and runs entirely in the terminal.

üß© Features

View all current bookings

Update existing booking details

Delete bookings easily

Menu-driven interface for simple navigation

Stores bookings in memory using Python dictionaries

üß† How It Works

The program starts with a main menu offering options to create, read, update, or delete a booking.

When creating a new booking:

The user inputs a Booking ID, Name, Movie Name, and Number of Tickets.

The booking is then stored in the global dictionary bookings.

The system allows:

Viewing all bookings in a formatted list

Updating existing booking information by Booking ID

Removing a booking from the dictionary
